# CS50_final

This is a final project for CS50, the introductory programming class at Harvard College (my first major programming project). This website is based off of the skeleton of CS50 finance (problem set 7). All files, with the exception of those within the vendor and includes folders, constitute original work by myself and my partner Brian Rolincik. All database management and SQL calls were also original work.

Note that this website is not currently live; it is powered by cloud 9 and is only available when I am actively running it from the cloud 9 ide.
